# Data Jourlnalism Using D3

## Objective

To create a interative dashboard using health data.

## Purpose

Build a interactive dashboard that plots health care information and also allows users to filter different inputs for the x and y axis that will update the scales for each different inputs.

Options for x-axis
- In Proverty (%)
- Age (Median)
- Household Income (Median)

Options for y-axis
- Obese (%)
- Smokes (%)
- Lacks Healthcare (%)

## Technologies Used

- Javascript
- HTML/CSS

## Modules Used

- d3.js

## Conclusion

***Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income***
There seems to be a strong correlation between the % that lacks healthcare and the % in poverty. It seems that the highest % in poverty and that lacks healthcare are mainly in the southern states. There is an outlier in Texas which is probably because it has such a large immigration population. The correlation between % in poverty and with % smokes is also really strong with the greatest % in poverty also has the % greatest that smokes. There doesn't seem to be a much of a correlation between % in poverty and % obesity which is around the range for obesity over the poverty range.
It seems that the median age group doesn't affect % that lack healthcare, smokes, or is obese because the majority of the age group is between 35 to 45 for majority of the country. There is a cluster of high % who smokes in the age group that is center around the midwest and southern states.
There is a strong correlation when it comes to household income with % lacking in healthcare, % smokes, and % obese. With lower income there is a higher % in all 3 other categories (healthcare, smokes, obesity) which makes sense because there would be less disposible income for healthcare and healthy eating.
