          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>

          <p>There seems to be a strong correlation between the % that lacks healthcare and the % in poverty.  It seems that the highest % in poverty and that lacks healthcare are mainly in the southern states.  There is an outlier in Texas which is probably because it has such a large immigration population.  The correlation between % in poverty and with % smokes is also really strong with the greatest % in poverty also has the % greatest that smokes.  There doesn't seem to be a much of a correlation between % in poverty and % obesity which is around the range for obesity over the poverty range.</p>



          <p>It seems that the median age group doesn't affect % that lack healthcare, smokes, or is obese because the majority of the age group is between 35 to 45 for majority of the country.  There is a cluster of high % who smokes in the age group that is center around the midwest and southern states.</p>



          <p>There is a strong correlation when it comes to household income with % lacking in healthcare, % smokes, and % obese.  With lower income there is a higher % in all 3 other categories (healthcare, smokes, obesity) which makes sense because there would be less disposible income for healthcare and healthy eating.</p>
